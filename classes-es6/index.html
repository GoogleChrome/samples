<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
  ES6 Classes formalize the common JavaScript pattern of simulating class-like inheritance hierarchies
  using functions and prototypes. They are effectively simple sugaring over prototype-based OO, offering
  a convenient declarative form for class patterns which encourage interoperability.
</p>
<p>
  Classes (as shipped in Chrome) support prototype-based inheritance, constructors, super calls, instance
  and static methods. The samples included in this are:Your IP: 116.32.214.238
