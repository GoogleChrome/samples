<p>
  <a href="http://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/subresourceintegrity/">Subresource integrity</a>
  defines a mechanism by which a browser can verify that a fetched resource has been delivered
  without unexpected manipulation.
  <a href="http://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/subresourceintegrity/#dfn-integrity-metadata">Metadata</a>
  inlined into HTML elements allows the browser to determine whether the resource that was
  downloaded matches the resource the page's author expected to download.
</p>

<p>
  The current implementation covers only the two elements outlined in the spec:
  <code>&lt;script></code> and <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet"></code> elements.
</p>

<p>
  This page attempts to load two local CSS resources. One is linked to with a valid hash, and the
  other is linked to with an invalid hash. Browsers that support subresource integrity will
  refuse to load the CSS resource with the invalid hash. In a real-world application, this might be
  more useful when you are calculating the hash of a third party, remote resource that you do not
  control, but local resources are being used for illustrative purposes.
</p>

<p id="correct">
  This paragraph is styled via the CSS resource linked to with
  <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="correct_hash.css" integrity="sha256-qvuZLpjL9TNV6yI1kNdGCPnSTrWM6Y0ILEzzyvA9hGY="></code>
  Since that uses an <code>integrity</code> attribute that corresponds to the actual hash of the
  file, it will be loaded successfully and this paragraph will be green.
  <code>cat correct_hash.css | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | openssl enc -base64 -A</code> was used
  to generate the <code>sha256</code> hash value.
</p>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="correct_hash.css" integrity="sha256-qvuZLpjL9TNV6yI1kNdGCPnSTrWM6Y0ILEzzyvA9hGY=">

<p id="incorrect">
  This paragraph is styled via the CSS resource linked to with
  <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="incorrect_hash.css" integrity="sha256-OBVIOUSLY_INCORRECT_HASH"></code>
  Browsers that support subresource integrity will refuse to load the file, since the
  <code>integrity</code> value  doesn't correspond to the actual <code>sha256</code> hash of the
  file. You'll see an error message logged in the DevTools console. Browsers that don't support
  subresource integrity will, however, load the file, and in those browsers this paragraph will be
  pink.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="incorrect_hash.css" integrity="sha256-OBVIOUSLY_INCORRECT_HASH">
