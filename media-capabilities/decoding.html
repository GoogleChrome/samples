<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
The <a href="https://wicg.github.io/media-capabilities/">Media Capabilities
 API</a> allows websites to get more information about the decoding
abilities of the device/system/browser. This enables web developers to make
optimal decisions when selecting media streams for the user.
</p>
<p>
Note that Chrome will always say that a supported media configuration is
<code>smooth</code> and <code>powerEfficient</code> until stats on this device
have been recorded.
