// While overkill for this specific sample in which there is only one cache,
// this is one best practice that can be followed in general to keep track of
// multiple caches used by a given service worker, and keep them all versioned.
// It maps a shorthand identifier for a cache to a specific, versioned cache name.

// Note that since global state is discarded in between service worker restarts, these
// variables will be reinitialized each time the service worker handles an event, and you
// should not attempt to change their values inside an event handler. (Treat them as constants.)

// If at any point you want to force pages that use this service worker to start using a fresh
// cache, then increment the CACHE_VERSION value. It will kick off the service worker update
// flow and the old cache(s) will be purged as part of the activate event handler when the
// updated service worker is activated.

  'read-through': 'read-through-cache-v' + CACHE_VERSION

  // While there is only one cache in this example, the same logic will handle the case where
  // there are multiple versioned caches.

// This sample illustrates an aggressive approach to caching, in which every valid response is
// cached and every request is first checked against the cache.
// This may not be an appropriate approach if your web application makes requests for
// arbitrary URLs as part of its normal operation (e.g. a RSS client or a news aggregator),
// as the cache could end up containing large responses that might not end up ever being accessed.
// Other approaches, like selectively caching based on response headers or only caching
// responses served from a specific domain, might be more appropriate for those use cases.
