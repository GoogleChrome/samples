    <h1>Service Worker Sample: Pre-fetching Resources During Registration</h1>

    <p>Available in <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/6561526227927040">Chrome 40+</a></p>

    <p>
      This sample demonstrates basic service worker registration, in conjunction with pre-fetching of a list
      of specific resource URLs during the installation phase.
    </p>

    <p>
      Visit <code>chrome://inspect/#service-workers</code> and click on the "inspect" link below
      the registered service worker to view logging statements for the various actions the
      <code><a href="service-worker.js">service-worker.js</a></code> script is performing.
      Since most of the action takes place during the service worker's install handler, and that is
      only executed the very first time you visit this page (unless the service worker script changes),
      it can be helpful to inspect the logging in a
      <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464">Chrome Incognito window</a>.
    </p>

    <div class="output">
      <div id="status"></div>

      <div id="files" style="display: none">
        <p>
          Some of the resources below have been pre-fetched, and some haven't. Try disabling your network connection
          and clicking on all the links. The resources that have been pre-fetched should be served from the Service
          Worker's cache and display as expected; the resource that hasn't been pre-fetched will be unavailable.
        </p>
